# Battleship project

This project consists on a study of different algorithms to beat the classis game "Battleship".

This project started as a way to make a CLI version of battleship but after it turned into implementing
some different algorithms to see which is the best.

## Running the script

First you would need to install python.

To see the results you only need to run the main python file with this command:

```
python main.py
```

After you can go into the `Simulation.py` and run the cells to see ther results.

Inspiration for some algorithms gotten from this [blog](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/index.html#google_vignette).
